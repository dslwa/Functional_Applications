# Functional Applications
## Figures_lab1
This Java project defines geometric shapes such as Circle, Square, and Triangle, along with the 3D Prism shape, all of which calculate their respective area, perimeter, surface area, and volume. The Figure class serves as an abstract base class for these shapes, providing the required methods for area and perimeter calculations. The Printable interface is implemented by all shapes to display their properties using the printf() method. The user interacts with the program through a console-based interface where they can choose which shape or prism to create, and input the required dimensions. The program includes error handling to ensure that invalid values, such as negative lengths, are not accepted, and provides feedback to the user in case of input errors.
